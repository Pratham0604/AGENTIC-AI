# ðŸ¤– AGENTIC-AI

This folder contains the core implementation of an **Agentic AI System**, a sophisticated application designed to autonomously achieve complex, multi-step goals with minimal human intervention.

Unlike a simple script or a single LLM call, this system employs a **multi-agent architecture** where specialized, goal-directed agents collaborate, plan, use tools, and self-correct to complete tasks.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Concepts

The system is built around the following core Agentic AI principles:

| Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Autonomy** | Agents can initiate actions and complete tasks without step-by-step human guidance. |
| **Tool Use** | Agents are equipped with external tools (APIs, code execution, databases, web search) to interact with the real world. |
| **Reasoning & Planning** | The system uses an LLM-powered loop (e.g., ReAct, Plan-and-Execute) to decompose a high-level goal into a sequence of executable steps. |
| **Self-Correction** | Agents can observe the result of their actions, detect errors, and dynamically adjust their plan or retry a step. |
| **Collaboration** | Multiple agents, each with a specialized `role`, `goal`, and `backstory`, work together to solve the problem (e.g., a **Researcher** hands off to a **Code Executor**). |

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Agentic AI project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python (3.10 or newer recommended)
* A valid API Key for the chosen Large Language Model (LLM) (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, etc.).

### 2. Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your-Repo-URL]
    cd agentic-ai
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure API Key:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your API key:
    ```
    # Replace with your actual key and variable name
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    # or
    GEMINI_API_KEY="AIza..." 
    ```

### 3. Execution

Run the main orchestration script:

```bash
python main.py
# or if using a specific example:
python examples/research_crew.py
